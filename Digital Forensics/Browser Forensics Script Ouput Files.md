# Browser Forensics Collection Script: Output and Usage Guide

### Description
The Browser Forensics Collection script gathers comprehensive forensic data from web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) on a Windows system. It collects internet history, saved passwords (domains and usernames), and other relevant web-related data if the browsers are installed on the host system.

### Usage

```powershell
.\BrowserForensics.ps1 -Days 7
```

### Parameters
- **Days**: The number of days worth of history to collect.

#### Outputs
The script generates several CSV files containing the collected data. These files are saved in a directory named `BrowserForensics-<hostname>-<date>`, where `<hostname>` is the name of the computer and `<date>` is the date the script was run.

### Output Files and Their Uses

#### 1. ChromeHistory.csv
- **Description**: Contains the browsing history from Google Chrome, including URLs, titles, visit counts, and last visit times.
- **Usage**: 
  - Identify websites visited within the specified period.
  - Correlate visit times with other events to trace user activity.
  - Detect access to suspicious or malicious websites.

#### 2. EdgeHistory.csv
- **Description**: Contains the browsing history from Microsoft Edge, including URLs, titles, visit counts, and last visit times.
- **Usage**: 
  - Similar to ChromeHistory.csv, used to identify websites visited within the specified period.
  - Helps in reconstructing user web activities and identifying potential security risks.

#### 3. FirefoxHistory_<profile>.csv
- **Description**: Contains the browsing history from Mozilla Firefox, including URLs, titles, visit counts, and last visit times. `<profile>` indicates the specific Firefox profile from which the data was collected.
- **Usage**: 
  - Useful for identifying visited websites and analyzing browsing behavior.
  - Cross-reference with other browser histories for comprehensive activity tracking.

#### 4. ChromePasswords.csv
- **Description**: Contains the saved passwords from Google Chrome, listing domains and usernames (passwords are excluded).
- **Usage**: 
  - Identify which websites have saved credentials.
  - Assess potential risks if usernames are known and passwords are compromised.
  - Check for reused usernames across different domains.

#### 5. EdgePasswords.csv
- **Description**: Contains the saved passwords from Microsoft Edge, listing domains and usernames (passwords are excluded).
- **Usage**: 
  - Similar to ChromePasswords.csv, helps identify websites with saved credentials.
  - Evaluate the security posture based on where credentials are stored.

#### 6. FirefoxPasswords_<profile>.csv
- **Description**: Contains the saved passwords from Mozilla Firefox, listing domains and usernames (passwords are excluded). `<profile>` indicates the specific Firefox profile from which the data was collected.
- **Usage**: 
  - Provides information on saved credentials and their associated domains.
  - Helps in understanding the scope of saved credentials across different browsers.

### How to Use the Outputs for Investigations

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Run the script with the desired number of days to collect data.
   - Ensure browsers are closed before running the script to avoid database lock issues.
   - Navigate to the output directory specified in the script output message.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Open the CSV files in a spreadsheet application or a data analysis tool.
   - Sort and filter data to focus on specific periods or domains of interest.
   - Cross-reference data between different browsers and other forensic artifacts to build a timeline of user activity.

3. **Investigation**:
   - Identify patterns of behavior by examining browsing histories.
   - Detect anomalies such as visits to known malicious sites.
   - Correlate saved credentials with other breach indicators to assess the impact of credential theft.

4. **Reporting**:
   - Summarize findings in a forensic report.
   - Highlight key events, such as visits to suspicious websites or the presence of saved credentials on high-risk domains.
   - Provide recommendations based on the analysis, such as changes to credential storage practices or increased monitoring of specific sites.

### Notes
- **Permissions**: The script should be run with administrative privileges to access browser data files.
- **Data Sensitivity**: Handle collected data with care, as it may contain sensitive information such as usernames and browsing histories.
- **Further Investigation**: Use the collected data as part of a broader forensic investigation, incorporating other sources of evidence such as system logs and network traffic analysis.
